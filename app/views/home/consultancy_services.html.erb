            <p>We at dine-media believe that a perfect analysis of business and process
              requirements leads to a successful project outcomes. We have experiences when clients come
              to us with a vague idea on what they want to do, we then sit with them and try to explore more
              on what they exactly want and improvise their idea into a proper Requirement Specification
              Document which not only helps us executing the project in a proper manner with clarity on what
              the end product will look like. We help the customer to redefine his requirements in a way which
              is easily understood by his target audience and helps him to market.</p>

                explores all the possible answers to all the confusions but gives an interesting outcome
                which can be readable by layman to understand the requirements.</li>
              <li><strong>Wireframes and Mocks:</strong>&nbsp;we do this to show how the end product will look like and how
                exactly it will function. It gives a rough idea of the outcome of the project as it has all the
                required fields drilled down to a granular level to help understand each module with all
                associated components</li>
